## About Me
*Howdy, and thanks for checking out my portfolio!*
My name is Ronnie, I'm an independent software developer looking to get
into the video game development industry. I've been learning computer science
and everything adjacent on my own since I was old enough to hold a joystick, 
and although it's been a bumpy road, I still have a deep passion for everything
games and computers. I've loved programming for as long as I can remember, am 
always learning something new, and am deeply looking forward to finding my
community!

## About the Portfolio
I'm still working on building it - there are a reasonable number of projects
I've worked on over the years (e.g., a couple simple [Godot games](#godot-games), a game using
[GameMaker](#gamemaker) (formerly Game Maker Studios 2)) that may very well be relevant to 
this, but for one reason or another I haven't included. As of 20250506, I'm 
currently working on furthering my knowledge of CMake so as to ensure any 
projects I include here are capable of cross-platform building, and ideally, 
should work "out of the box." 

### Godot Games

#### Unnamed projects
Various others: a dungeon diver showcasing traveling between rooms using
a fade transition effect, a crafting game where you run around harvesting
nodes from the environment to use as ingredients for crafting various
items, and an arena fighter in which enemies spawn with increased frequency
the longer you survive, to name a few.
